Tree with concordance factors written to gCF_concat.cf.tree
Annotated tree (best viewed in FigTree) written to gCF_concat.cf.tree.nex
Tree with branch IDs written to gCF_concat.cf.branch
Concordance factors per branch printed to gCF_concat.cf.stat
WARNING: You probably want the --scfl option. The site concordance factor
 implemented with the --scf option is based on parsimony (described here:
 https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa106). It has since been superseded by a more
 accurate likelihood-based approach which is implemented in the --scfl option, and
 is described in the paper "Updated site concordance factors minimize effects of
 homoplasy and taxon sampling" by Yu et al.. Please see the tutorial here for more
